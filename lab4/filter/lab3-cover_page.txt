CSE132 Lab 3

*******NOTE: I missed the first two labs in the first week so my lab 1 is late. I already talked to Professor Chamberlain about this and he said because lab 2 and lab 1 are dependent of each other, as long as I turn in lab 1 before lab 2 is due I should be fine. Thank you.********************************
