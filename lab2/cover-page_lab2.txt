CSE132 Lab 1

*******NOTE: I missed the first two labs in the first week so my lab 1 is late. I already talked to Professor Chamberlain about this and he said because lab 2 and lab 1 are dependent of each other, as long as I turn in lab 1 before lab 2 is due I should be fine. Thank you.********************************

Record how well (or poorly) the program maintains the timing specification of one reading per second.
The time interval recorded using the delta method outputs 1000ms, 1001ms, or 1002ms, etc. Which indicates that the time recording is relatively accurate.

Double filterSize and re-examine the timing specification. 
When we use the delay command, after doubling the filter size from 5 to 10, 1003ms starts occurring, and 1002ms appear more often than 2001ms.
Therefore, the timing is a little bit inaccurate when we double the filter size.
When the delta time technique is used, the time specification is much better, and the difference between the two filter sizes isn't as prominent as before.
